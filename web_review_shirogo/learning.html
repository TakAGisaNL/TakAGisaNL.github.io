      Blue Archive is a very popular gacha game that has players assuming the
      role of a teacher at a school which is designed to train young girls into
      being defenders of the Earth, with guns of course. The game is all about
      training, growing, and expanding your roster of characters. You do this by
      grinding a lot of bosses and also trying to pull on a character from the
      current banner! If you're looking for a shortcut to get good rewards, then
      you best use the codes. They're helpful for all Blue Archive players and
      will assist you in achieving your goals of having the best students and
      the best team compositions in the game.
